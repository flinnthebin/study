Introduction:

Design patterns are a key aspect of software engineering that provide solutions to recurring problems in software development. The "gang of four" design patterns, introduced in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", represent a collection of 23 design patterns that are widely used in the software development community. These patterns provide a common vocabulary and a shared understanding of best practices in software design, making it easier for software developers to communicate and collaborate on complex projects.

Classification of Design Patterns:

The "gang of four" design patterns are classified into three categories: creational, structural, and behavioral.

    Creational patterns deal with the process of object creation. These patterns provide solutions to the problem of creating objects in a manner suitable to the situation, while hiding the implementation details from the client. Some of the creational patterns include Singleton, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory.

    Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects. These patterns provide solutions to the problem of arranging objects and classes in a manner that is efficient and scalable, while still preserving the overall structure of the system. Some of the structural patterns include Adapter, Bridge, and Decorator.

    Behavioral patterns deal with the communication between objects. These patterns provide solutions to the problem of managing the flow of control between objects, while ensuring that the objects interact in a manner that is appropriate and well-defined. Some of the behavioral patterns include Observer, Command, and State.

Benefits of Design Patterns:

The use of design patterns in software development provides several benefits, including:

    Reusability: Design patterns are reusable solutions to recurring problems in software development. By using design patterns, software developers can avoid reinventing the wheel and focus on solving new and unique problems.

    Maintainability: Design patterns provide a common vocabulary and a shared understanding of best practices in software design. This makes it easier for software developers to communicate and collaborate on complex projects, which can result in more maintainable and scalable software systems.

    Flexibility: Design patterns are flexible solutions that can be adapted to meet the specific needs of a particular project. By using design patterns, software developers can create software systems that are flexible, scalable, and adaptable to changing requirements.

Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with the process of object creation. The primary goal of creational patterns is to provide a solution to the problem of creating objects in a manner suitable to the situation, while hiding the implementation details from the client. In other words, creational patterns aim to abstract the process of object creation and provide a way for the client to create objects without knowing how the objects are actually created.

Some of the most commonly used creational patterns include:

    Builder: The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. This pattern is useful when you want to create objects that are composed of many different parts, and where the process of creating these objects can be complex. An example usage of the Builder pattern might be a car factory that builds cars using a standard set of steps, but allows the customer to choose different options to customize the car.

    Singleton: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, while providing a global point of access to this instance. This pattern is useful when you need to ensure that a class only has one instance, and that this instance is easily accessible from anywhere in the system. An example usage of the Singleton pattern might be a database connection manager that ensures that there is only one connection to the database, and that this connection is easily accessible from anywhere in the system.

    Factory Method: The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is useful when you want to encapsulate the process of object creation, but still allow subclasses to specify the type of objects that are created. An example usage of the Factory Method pattern might be a graphics application that provides a factory method for creating shapes, but allows subclasses to specify the type of shapes that are created (e.g. circles, rectangles, etc.).

    Abstract Factory: The Abstract Factory pattern provides a way to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is useful when you want to create objects that are related to one another, but do not want to specify the exact classes of these objects. An example usage of the Abstract Factory pattern might be a game engine that provides an abstract factory for creating game objects, but allows subclasses to specify the exact types of game objects that are created (e.g. characters, weapons, etc.).

    Prototype: The Prototype pattern creates new objects by cloning an existing object, rather than creating new objects from scratch. This pattern is useful when you want to create objects that are similar to existing objects, but with some modifications. An example usage of the Prototype pattern might be a document editor that allows users to create new documents based on existing templates, but with the ability to modify the content of the new document.

These are just a few examples of creational patterns, and there are many others as well. Creational patterns provide a way to encapsulate the process of object creation and provide a way for the client to create objects without knowing how the objects are actually created. By using creational patterns, software developers can create more flexible and maintainable software systems.


Structural patterns are design patterns that deal with the composition of classes and objects. The primary goal of structural patterns is to provide a solution to the problem of arranging objects and classes in a manner that is efficient and scalable, while still preserving the overall structure of the system. In other words, structural patterns aim to provide ways to organize objects and classes in a way that makes it easy to add new functionality, modify existing functionality, and scale the system as needed.

Some of the most commonly used structural patterns include:

    Adapter: The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one object into an interface that is compatible with another object. This pattern is useful when you want to integrate existing objects into a new system, but the interfaces of these objects are not compatible. An example usage of the Adapter pattern might be a legacy system that needs to integrate with a new system, but the data formats are not compatible.

    Bridge: The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can easily be modified and scaled, without changing the underlying implementation. An example usage of the Bridge pattern might be a graphics engine that provides a bridge between the abstract representation of a scene and the underlying implementation of the graphics engine.

    Composite: The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that treats individual objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner. An example usage of the Composite pattern might be a file system that treats files and directories in a uniform manner, allowing the user to operate on either a single file or a group of files in the same way.

    Decorator: The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is useful when you want to add new functionality to an object, but do not want to change the underlying class. An example usage of the Decorator pattern might be a web page that allows users to add new widgets and decorations to a page, without changing the underlying HTML code.

    Facade: The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system, hiding the implementation details. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that is easy to use, but that still provides access to the underlying functionality when needed. An example usage of the Facade pattern might be a library that provides a simple interface to a complex data storage system, allowing the client to store and retrieve data without having to know the details of the underlying storage system.

    Flyweight: The Flyweight pattern uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can manage a large number of objects, but where the memory overhead of creating these objects is too high. An example usage of the Flyweight pattern might be a game that manages a large number of characters, but where the characters are similar to one another and can be shared between instances.

    Proxy: The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that controls access to an object, but without having to change the underlying object. An example usage of the Proxy pattern might be a security system that controls access to a file, but without having to change the underlying file.

These are just a few examples of structural patterns, and there are many others as well. Structural patterns provide a way to organize objects and classes in a way that makes it easy to add new functionality, modify existing functionality, and scale the system as needed. By using structural patterns, software developers can create more flexible and maintainable software systems.


Behavioral patterns are design patterns that deal with the communication between objects. The primary goal of behavioral patterns is to provide a solution to the problem of managing the flow of control between objects, while ensuring that the objects interact in a manner that is appropriate and well-defined. In other words, behavioral patterns aim to provide ways to manage the communication and interaction between objects in a way that is efficient, flexible, and maintainable.

Some of the most commonly used behavioral patterns include:    

    Chain of Responsibility: The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to pass requests along a dynamic chain of receivers until one of them handles the request. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can handle requests in a flexible manner, without having to tightly couple the objects that handle the requests. An example usage of the Chain of Responsibility pattern might be a help system that passes requests for help along a chain of help topics, until one of the topics can provide the requested information.

    Command: The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for the parametrization of clients with different requests, and the queuing or logging of requests. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can execute requests in a flexible and maintainable manner. An example usage of the Command pattern might be a media player that allows users to queue up a list of songs, and play them in the order specified.

    Interpreter: The Interpreter pattern provides a way to evaluate sentences in a language. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can interpret sentences written in a specific language. An example usage of the Interpreter pattern might be a calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions written in a specific syntax.

    Iterator: The Iterator pattern provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially, without exposing the underlying representation. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can iterate over a collection of objects, without having to know the underlying representation of the objects. An example usage of the Iterator pattern might be a library that provides a way to iterate over a collection of books, without having to know the details of how the books are stored.

    Mediator: The Mediator pattern provides a way to define a separate object that controls the communication between other objects. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can manage the communication between objects, without having to tightly couple the objects. An example usage of the Mediator pattern might be an auction system that manages the communication between bidders and sellers, without having to know the details of the individual bidders and seller: The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows you to pass requests along a dynamic chain of receivers until one of them handles the request. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can handle requests in a flexible manner, without having to tightly couple the objects that handle the requests. An example usage of the Chain of Responsibility pattern might be a help system that passes requests for help along a chain of help topics, until one of the topics can provide the requested information.

    Memento: The Memento pattern provides a way to capture the internal state of an object, and restore the state later. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can undo and redo operations, or save and restore the state of an object. An example usage of the Memento pattern might be a text editor that allows users to undo and redo operations, by capturing the state of the text before and after each operation.

    Observer: The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, such that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system where objects can be notified of changes to other objects, without having to tightly couple the objects. An example usage of the Observer pattern might be a stock market ticker that notifies subscribers of changes to stock prices.

    State: The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. This pattern is useful when you want to create objects that can change their behavior based on their internal state, without having to change the underlying class. An example usage of the State pattern might be a vending machine that changes its behavior based on the state of the machine (e.g. out of stock, waiting for payment, dispensing product, etc.).

    Strategy: The Strategy pattern provides a way to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make the algorithms interchangeable. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can change its behavior based on the context in which it is used. An example usage of the Strategy pattern might be a sorting algorithm that can sort data using different sorting algorithms, depending on the specific requirements of the data.

    Template Method: The Template Method pattern provides a way to define the skeleton of an algorithm, deferring some steps to subclasses. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can change the specific details of an algorithm, while still maintaining the overall structure of the algorithm. An example usage of the Template Method pattern might be a recipe for baking a cake, where the recipe provides the overall structure for baking the cake, but allows the baker to choose different ingredients and baking methods to create a unique cake.

    Visitor: The Visitor pattern provides a way to add new operations to existing classes, without changing the classes. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can perform operations on a collection of objects, without having to change the objects. An example usage of the Visitor pattern might be a shopping cart that can calculate the total cost of a collection of items, without having to change the individual items.

These are just a few examples of behavioral patterns, and there are many others as well. Behavioral patterns provide a way to manage the communication and interaction between objects in a way that is efficient, flexible, and maintainable. By using behavioral patterns, software developers can create more flexible and maintainable software systems.
