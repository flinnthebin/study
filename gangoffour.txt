Introduction:

Design patterns are a key aspect of software engineering that provide solutions to recurring problems in software development. The "gang of four" design patterns, introduced in the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", represent a collection of 23 design patterns that are widely used in the software development community. These patterns provide a common vocabulary and a shared understanding of best practices in software design, making it easier for software developers to communicate and collaborate on complex projects.

Classification of Design Patterns:

The "gang of four" design patterns are classified into three categories: creational, structural, and behavioral.

    Creational patterns deal with the process of object creation. These patterns provide solutions to the problem of creating objects in a manner suitable to the situation, while hiding the implementation details from the client. Some of the creational patterns include Singleton, Factory Method, and Abstract Factory.

    Structural patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects. These patterns provide solutions to the problem of arranging objects and classes in a manner that is efficient and scalable, while still preserving the overall structure of the system. Some of the structural patterns include Adapter, Bridge, and Decorator.

    Behavioral patterns deal with the communication between objects. These patterns provide solutions to the problem of managing the flow of control between objects, while ensuring that the objects interact in a manner that is appropriate and well-defined. Some of the behavioral patterns include Observer, Command, and State.

Benefits of Design Patterns:

The use of design patterns in software development provides several benefits, including:

    Reusability: Design patterns are reusable solutions to recurring problems in software development. By using design patterns, software developers can avoid reinventing the wheel and focus on solving new and unique problems.

    Maintainability: Design patterns provide a common vocabulary and a shared understanding of best practices in software design. This makes it easier for software developers to communicate and collaborate on complex projects, which can result in more maintainable and scalable software systems.

    Flexibility: Design patterns are flexible solutions that can be adapted to meet the specific needs of a particular project. By using design patterns, software developers can create software systems that are flexible, scalable, and adaptable to changing requirements.


Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with the process of object creation. The primary goal of creational patterns is to provide a solution to the problem of creating objects in a manner suitable to the situation, while hiding the implementation details from the client. In other words, creational patterns aim to abstract the process of object creation and provide a way for the client to create objects without knowing how the objects are actually created.

Some of the most commonly used creational patterns include:

    Singleton: The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, while providing a global point of access to this instance. This pattern is useful when you need to ensure that a class only has one instance, and that this instance is easily accessible from anywhere in the system. An example usage of the Singleton pattern might be a database connection manager that ensures that there is only one connection to the database, and that this connection is easily accessible from anywhere in the system.

    Factory Method: The Factory Method pattern provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is useful when you want to encapsulate the process of object creation, but still allow subclasses to specify the type of objects that are created. An example usage of the Factory Method pattern might be a graphics application that provides a factory method for creating shapes, but allows subclasses to specify the type of shapes that are created (e.g. circles, rectangles, etc.).

    Abstract Factory: The Abstract Factory pattern provides a way to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is useful when you want to create objects that are related to one another, but do not want to specify the exact classes of these objects. An example usage of the Abstract Factory pattern might be a game engine that provides an abstract factory for creating game objects, but allows subclasses to specify the exact types of game objects that are created (e.g. characters, weapons, etc.).

These are just a few examples of creational patterns, and there are many others as well. Creational patterns provide a way to encapsulate the process of object creation and provide a way for the client to create objects without knowing how the objects are actually created. By using creational patterns, software developers can create more flexible and maintainable software systems.


Structural patterns are design patterns that deal with the composition of classes and objects. The primary goal of structural patterns is to provide a solution to the problem of arranging objects and classes in a manner that is efficient and scalable, while still preserving the overall structure of the system. In other words, structural patterns aim to provide ways to organize objects and classes in a way that makes it easy to add new functionality, modify existing functionality, and scale the system as needed.

Some of the most commonly used structural patterns include:

    Adapter: The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one object into an interface that is compatible with another object. This pattern is useful when you want to integrate existing objects into a new system, but the interfaces of these objects are not compatible. An example usage of the Adapter pattern might be a legacy system that needs to integrate with a new system, but the data formats are not compatible.

    Bridge: The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can easily be modified and scaled, without changing the underlying implementation. An example usage of the Bridge pattern might be a graphics engine that provides a bridge between the abstract representation of a scene and the underlying implementation of the graphics engine.

    Decorator: The Decorator pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This pattern is useful when you want to add new functionality to an object, but do not want to change the underlying class. An example usage of the Decorator pattern might be a web page that allows users to add new widgets and decorations to a page, without changing the underlying HTML code.

These are just a few examples of structural patterns, and there are many others as well. Structural patterns provide a way to organize objects and classes in a way that makes it easy to add new functionality, modify existing functionality, and scale the system as needed. By using structural patterns, software developers can create more flexible and maintainable software systems.


Behavioral patterns are design patterns that deal with the communication between objects. The primary goal of behavioral patterns is to provide a solution to the problem of managing the flow of control between objects, while ensuring that the objects interact in a manner that is appropriate and well-defined. In other words, behavioral patterns aim to provide ways to manage the communication and interaction between objects in a way that is efficient, flexible, and maintainable.

Some of the most commonly used behavioral patterns include:

    Observer: The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, such that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system where objects can be notified of changes to other objects, without having to tightly couple the objects. An example usage of the Observer pattern might be a stock market ticker that notifies subscribers of changes to stock prices.

    Command: The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for the parametrization of clients with different requests, and the queuing or logging of requests. This pattern is useful when you want to create a system that can execute requests in a flexible and maintainable manner. An example usage of the Command pattern might be a media player that allows users to queue up a list of songs, and play them in the order specified.

    State: The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. This pattern is useful when you want to create objects that can change their behavior based on their internal state, without having to change the underlying class. An example usage of the State pattern might be a vending machine that changes its behavior based on the state of the machine (e.g. out of stock, waiting for payment, dispensing product, etc.).

These are just a few examples of behavioral patterns, and there are many others as well. Behavioral patterns provide a way to manage the communication and interaction between objects in a way that is efficient, flexible, and maintainable. By using behavioral patterns, software developers can create more flexible and maintainable software systems.
