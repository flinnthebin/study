# Physical Security in Aviation

- Insider threats (co-pilots with mental health issues)
- Workplace politics (co-pilots using the security mechanisms as tools for petty games)
- A reinforced cabin door doesn't seem very secure if would-be hijackers can extract the emergency access codes from the crewmembers
- A fault on a reinforced cabin door means that when the door jams, you're not likely to be able to fix it mid-air
- A reinforced cabin door that is too secure and unable to be accessed by crew could facilitate deranged murder-suicide attempts (MH370)
